# Progress — Rent-Yield Screener

## Active task

**PHASE INFRA (Playbook Phase 3) IN PROGRESS — plan APPROVED w/ amendments A1–A5 + full-send execution notes (Mekyle, 2026-07-10). T1 DONE; next = T2 (live hook verification).** Task list + ACs live in ROADMAP.md § Phase INFRA (persisted first, commit 811465f). Model plan this week: attended T1–T7 + T7.5 review on strong model (headroom exception); ADR-0005 records Sonnet as standing default; T8 loop `--model sonnet` exactly as it runs overnight.

<details><summary>Phase B fix-pass record (all findings FIXED; test-first → fix → atomic commit each; git log fa78ca3..c9c9c16)</summary>
1. ✅ d424071 — winding fixed at source (build-boundaries.ts `-o gj2008` = CW/d3 rings) + map:verify geometry guard (no path bbox may span the viewBox) + tests/map.test.ts
2. ✅ 9f7d8a2 — validate default mode dies FETCH_INTEGRITY: on zero inputs (no vacuous pass)
3. ✅ ede3d0f — csv cells: trim, keep only finite Number, else null (" "→null, "NA"→null)
4. ✅ c4c15f4 — crosswalk generator enforces CBSA global uniqueness (1:1 both ways); --src/--out added
5. ✅ 71d36b2 — num() rejects NaN thresholds; flag() honors --flag=value
6. ✅ e64eb00 — median() throws on empty; distribution check skipped for zero zips
7. ✅ e47eb46 — parseCsv throws clear error on empty/headerless file
8. ✅ 7945d31 — map:verify latest.json read guarded → MAP_VERIFY: token
9. ✅ 39c5902 — fetch.ts res.text() guarded + main().catch(fail) → FETCH_INTEGRITY:
10. ✅ f472e71 — national row excluded by RegionID 102001 / RegionType country, not SizeRank

Below-cap, fixed alongside: 11 ✅ be62d8a (trim-fixtures lexical sort, not localeCompare); 12 ✅ 3653981 (fixture vs live map builds write DISTINCT files — committed metro-map.svg vs gitignored metro-map.live.svg; map:verify + CI + ROADMAP B.4 AC + .gitignore updated). Findings 13–21 remain queued (Phase 5 hardening / cheap cleanup) — see reviews/phase-b-code-review.md.

Re-review fix: c9c9c16 — finding-#5 `--flag=value` support let the csvPaths filter swallow a positional CSV path after an equals-form flag (`--min-metros=500 file.csv` → silent default mode, wrong files at exit 0). Regression test + one-line fix.

## Status

**PHASE INFRA T1 COMPLETE ✅ — hooks layer live in repo (not yet loaded in a session; T2 verifies wiring).** Test-first: 82-case matrix RED → 4 hooks implemented → GREEN; Mekyle's mid-task additions (bare-force push, PowerShell Remove-Item/aliases, iwr/irm→iex pipes) added RED (26 fail) → pre-bash.mjs extended → 110/110 GREEN. `.claude/settings.json` committed wiring pre-bash + pre-edit + stop-tests (post-edit wired at T3); settings.local.json pruned 55→12 durable patterns. Phase B record: closed 2026-07-08, CI green c9c9c16 (see git history of this file for the fix-pass ledger).

## Last action & result

2026-07-10: Phase INFRA plan approved (amendments A1–A5); ROADMAP.md § Phase INFRA persisted first (811465f). T1 done test-first: `npm test` → 110 hook cases + full suite green; fail-closed verified (malformed stdin → exit 2 `HOOK_ERROR: fail-closed`); checkPush loop confirmed appearing exactly once in pre-bash.mjs (grep -c = 1; user's terminal showed a render artifact).

## Next action

**T2 — live hook verification on Windows.** The hooks in `.claude/settings.json` are NOT loaded into the current session (hook config snapshots at session start) → needs a fresh session (or /hooks review) BEFORE provoking: `rm -rf` outside repo → denied; `git push --force origin main` → denied; break a test then stop → stop blocked. Record observed transcript behavior here. Then T3 (Prettier = Rung 2 trial via /goal), T4 (ruleset), T5 (image), T6 (SUPERVISED credentials), T7 (loop.sh), T7.5 (scoped review gate, scope estimate + approval first), T8 (dry-run), T9 (close-out).

- GUARDRAIL (Mekyle, 2026-07-08): before launching >5 subagents OR any full-codebase/full-phase review, state estimated scope and WAIT for approval (saved to memory: subagent-scope-approval).

## Learnings / guardrails

- ETL determinism is constitutional (VI): always compare double-run outputs with `diff -r` before claiming done.
- Attribution is CI-asserted, not remembered (constitution V).
- NEVER pipe verification commands through `tail`/`head` when claiming a pass — it hid 3 local typecheck errors that then failed CI (B.2). Always show the exit code (`${PIPESTATUS[0]}` if piped).
- ZIP-level Zillow data has legitimate extreme outliers (thin ZORI samples in luxury ZIPs) — hard range asserts on ZIP records will falsely fail live runs.

## Blockers / open questions

- ~~gh CLI not installed~~ RESOLVED: gh 2.96.0 present (verified 2026-07-07).
- Task C.4 (SEO scale) blocked on Mekyle's Keywords Everywhere export → judged by pre-registered rule.
- B.4 crosswalk source must be stated to Mekyle before building (approval note 4).

## Loop control

Rung 2, Phase INFRA executing (plan approved 2026-07-10). Per-task rule: end with AC command + real output in chat, ONE atomic commit, PROGRESS.md updated. Stop conditions ahead: T6 SUPERVISED (Mekyle creates PAT + setup-token) · T7.5 scope estimate → WAIT for approval · T8 watched live · Phase INFRA exit = V1–V6 green + T7.5 passed, then Phase C plan checkpoint. First overnight run is a Phase C decision, never launched from this phase.
